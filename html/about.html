        <h1>About ML Strength</h1>
        <p>
          ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with
          gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength
          believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving your health
          is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight
          loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more
          energy, or just looking and feeling better - we're here for you!
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest
          of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying
          telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for
          themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of
          mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine
          dreams up.â€¯ You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at
          your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health
          club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride
          ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation,
          no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit
          rate.
